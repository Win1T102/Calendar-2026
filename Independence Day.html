    <h1>Independence Day</h1>
    <p>On June 12, 1898, rebel leader Emilio Aguinaldo declared the Philippines’ independence from the window of his ancestral home in Cavite el Viejo (now Kawit, Cavite), founding a provisional republic with himself as president. At the time, the Philippines had been under Spanish colonial rule for more than 300 years, and Aguinaldo’s declaration was meant to mark the end of that rule after the Philippine Revolution.</p>
